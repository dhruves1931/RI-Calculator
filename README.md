**Introduction**
Being an electrical engineer sometimes it is tedious and time-consuming to calculate the values of electronic components.  The project made by us is also helpful for those who are new to this concept and want to learn from scratch, as we know that when we learn and understand any concept visually it's easier to learn. Here in this project, we have used Java and Java swing. It is a GUI widget toolkit for Java. In this project, the user can calculate Resistance and Inductance using color codes for all the bands viz. 3, 4, 5, and 6 bands for Resistance and 4 and 5 bands for Inductance. To make it more informative we have added some facts and information.

**About Resistor and inductors and their uses**
1) Resistor:
   In the 1950s, the increased production of resistors created the need for standardized resistance values. The range of resistance values is standardized with so-called preferred values. The preferred values are defined in E-series. In an E-series, every value is a certain percentage higher than the previous. Various E-series exist for different tolerances. There is a huge variation in fields of applications for resistors; from precision components in digital electronics to measurement devices for physical quantities. A passive electrical component with two terminals that are used for either limiting or regulating the flow of electric current in electrical circuits. The SI unit of the resistor is Ohm. The international IEC symbol is a rectangular shape with leads at each end as shown below. In the USA, the ANSI standard is very common and represents a fixed resistor as a zigzag line.

•	Uses of Resistor:
1.	The main application of resistors is storing data in digital form.
2.	They also can hold data and address
3.	The registers are also used to make digital memory chips like ROM Chips, Flash Memory etc.
4.	Cache memory in the CPU is also made by registers.

2) Inductor:
Inductors much like conductors and resistors are simple components that are used in electronic devices to carry out specific functions. Normally, inductors are coil-like structures that are found in electronic circuits. The coil is an insulated wire that is looped around the central core. Inductors are mostly used to decrease or control the electric spikes by storing energy temporarily in an electromagnetic field and then releasing it back into the circuit. An inductor is a passive component that is used in most power electronic circuits to store energy in the form of magnetic energy when electricity is applied to it. The S.I. unit of inductance is henry (H) and when we measure magnetic circuits it is equivalent to weber/ampere. It is denoted by the symbol L. Symbols for an inductor are given below:

•	Uses of Inductor:
1.Inductors are primarily used in electrical power and electronic devices for these major purposes: Choking, blocking, attenuating, or filtering/smoothing high-frequency noise in electrical circuits.
2. It is also used in storing and transferring energy in power converters (dc-dc or ac-dc)

**How color Coding works**
It is sometimes not obvious whether a color-coded component is a resistor, capacitor, or inductor, and this may be deduced by knowledge of its circuit function, physical shape or by measurement. Resistor values are always coded in ohms (symbol Ω), capacitors in picofarads (pF), and inductors in microhenries (µH). The color bands on the body of the resistor tell how much resistance it has. The standard color code marking consists of four bands around the body of the resistor (if the resistor is 4 band resistor). The colors and their numerical values are given in the resistor color chart. The color of the first band indicates the first significant figure of the resistance value. The second band indicates the second significant value. The color of the third band indicates the number of zeros that follow the first two significant figures. If the third band is gold or silver then the third band indicates the fractional value of the first two significant figures.
▪ A gold band means the resistance is 1/10 the value of the first two significant figures.
▪ A silver band means the resistance is 1/100 the value of the first two significant figures.

The inductance of an inductor can be calculated with the colors of the bands. Inductors can have four or five bands. Smaller inductors use numbers instead of colors. Most inductors have four bands. The first two of these represent a two-digit significant number. The third band represents the multiplier. The inductance is calculated by multiplying the significant number by ten to the power of the value of the third band. The fourth band represents the tolerance. This is given as a percentage and indicates the error your inductor might have. Five band inductors have an additional silver band at the beginning, which is a military identifier. Five band inductors work the same as their four band counterparts.
